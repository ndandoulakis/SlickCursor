SlickCursor analyzes the screen to detect _interesting_ visual content. This way, the user can move the mouse cursor between adjacent graphical objects, such as, lines of text, menu options, icons, buttons, etc, with a single key press.

SlickCursor is resource friendly, it keeps both CPU and memory usage low.

To have a view of what SlickCursor does behind the scenes, click SlickCursor's icon (taskbar notification area) and select "Show Inspector".
