SlickCursor is a mouse emulator, a software that enables users to control their mouse with a keyboard.
Additionally, SlickCursor enhances mouse emulation with on-the-fly [screen analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_analysis).

With a single key press, users are able to move the mouse cursor, up and down, over *navigable* screen sections - a functionality that resembles menu item selection with keyboard.

*Navigable* sections are detected on-the-fly, while users operate the application. The sections are never displayed on the screen because users don't need to be aware of them. They are visible only through the *Inspector* window.
